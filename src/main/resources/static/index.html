<h3>Spring Events & Listeners</h3>
<p>
    This code example simulates part of a web blog site.
    Specifically, it allows posting new posts and commenting existing posts.
</p>
<p>
    Do not expect to view the posts or the comments though. It is not relevant to this code example; all we want
    to see is how events are being published or listened to.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to custom events, the example contains also listeners to existing system events provided
    by Spring: ContextRefreshedEvent and RequestHandledEvent
    (<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-context-events">there are more</a>).
